# Chezmoi Dotfiles Philosophy Audit Report

Generated: 2025-07-20

## Executive Summary

This audit was conducted to identify and fix violations of the 10 core philosophical principles outlined in CLAUDE.md. The most critical idempotency violations in the package installation script have been fixed, along with several other issues.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Critical Idempotency Violations in Package Installation**

**File:** `run_always_update-packages.sh.tmpl`

**Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ Docker Desktop installation now checks if already installed (manually or via brew)
- ✅ terraform/tenv conflict now handled gracefully with automatic unlinking
- ✅ Individual package installation with proper error handling
- ✅ Changed `exit 1` to `return 1` in spinner function to avoid breaking entire script
- ✅ Added checks before installing each package to prevent redundant operations

**Philosophy Principles Addressed:**
- Principle 1: Idempotency - Script now runs multiple times without errors
- Principle 3: Fail Fast, Fail Gracefully - Validates before installing, continues on expected failures

### 2. **Package Mode Selection Mechanism**

**File:** `.chezmoidata.yaml`

**Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ Added automatic loading of packages based on `DOTFILES_MODE` environment variable
- ✅ Defaults to "full" mode for backward compatibility
- ✅ Properly includes either `packages.yaml` or `packages-minimal.yaml`

**Philosophy Principles Addressed:**
- Principle 6: Single Source of Truth - One mechanism for mode selection
- Principle 4: No Surprises - Clear mode indicator in output

### 3. **Template File Naming Violation**

**File:** `dot_zshrc` → `dot_zshrc.tmpl`

**Issues Fixed:**
- ✅ Renamed file to have .tmpl extension since it contains template syntax

**Philosophy Principles Addressed:**
- Principle 4: No Surprises - File extension now matches content
- Principle 8: Self-Documenting - Clear indication of template files

## Remaining Issues for Future Work

### 1. **Idempotency Issues in Other Scripts**

Several scripts still have minor idempotency violations:

- `run_onchange_setup-mise.sh.tmpl`: Uses `|| true` but could be more robust
- `run_onchange_setup-advanced-git.sh.tmpl`: Exits if tools not found instead of installing them
- `run_weekly_safe-upgrades.sh.tmpl`: Still uses `exit 1` in spinner function

### 2. **GPG Key ID Inconsistency**

- `run_onchange_import-gpg-key.sh.tmpl` has key ID: `AC9715E1C25B4B8A`
- `CLAUDE.md` references key ID: `21D39CC1D0B3B44A`
- This violates Principle 6: Single Source of Truth

### 3. **Error Handling Improvements Needed**

Several scripts use `set -euo pipefail` but don't handle expected failures gracefully: # TODO which scripts?
- Missing pre-checks before operations
- No validation of prerequisites
- Limited user guidance when failures occur

### 4. **Lack of Validation Functions**

Many scripts repeat similar validation logic instead of using shared functions.

## Recommendations for Maintaining Philosophy

### 1. **Establish a Pre-Commit Hook**

Create a pre-commit hook that checks for:
- Files with template syntax but no .tmpl extension
- Scripts without proper error handling
- Non-idempotent operations

### 2. **Create Shared Library Functions**

Develop a shared library (`common-functions.sh`) with:
```bash
# Check if package is installed
is_brew_package_installed() { ... }
is_brew_cask_installed() { ... }
is_system_package_installed() { ... }

# Idempotent installation functions
install_brew_package() { ... }
install_brew_cask() { ... }
```

### 3. **Standardize Error Handling Pattern**

Replace simple `|| true` with more informative handling:
```bash
if ! some_command; then
  echo "⚠️  Expected failure: [explanation]"
  # Take corrective action or continue
fi
```

### 4. **Add Integration Tests**

Create tests that verify:
- Scripts can run multiple times without errors
- Mode switching works correctly
- Package installation is truly idempotent

### 5. **Document Mode Selection**

Add clear documentation about:
- How to set `DOTFILES_MODE`
- What each mode includes
- How to switch between modes

### 6. **Centralize Configuration**

Consider moving all configuration constants (like GPG key IDs) to `.chezmoidata.yaml` to maintain single source of truth.

## Compliance Score

Based on the 10 philosophical principles:

| Principle                      | Status          | Score |
|--------------------------------|-----------------|-------|
| 1. Idempotency                 | Partially Fixed | 7/10  |
| 2. Declarative Over Imperative | Good            | 8/10  |
| 3. Fail Fast, Fail Gracefully  | Improved        | 6/10  |
| 4. No Surprises                | Good            | 8/10  |
| 5. Progressive Enhancement     | Excellent       | 9/10  |
| 6. Single Source of Truth      | Needs Work      | 5/10  |
| 7. Security by Default         | Good            | 9/10  |
| 8. Self-Documenting            | Good            | 7/10  |
| 9. Minimal Side Effects        | Good            | 8/10  |
| 10. Version Control Friendly   | Excellent       | 10/10 |

**Overall Score: 77/100**

## Conclusion

The most critical idempotency violations have been fixed, particularly in the package installation system. The dotfiles now properly handle Docker Desktop installations, terraform/tenv conflicts, and support mode-based package loading.

However, there's still work to be done to achieve full compliance with all philosophical principles. The recommendations above provide a path toward a more robust and maintainable dotfiles system.
